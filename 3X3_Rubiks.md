### Step 1: ###

**Make the Daisy: Yello Center sourrended by 4 white sedge pieces at the top.**

### Step 2: ###

**Create white Cross at the bottom with Side center matching.**





<br> <br> <br>
### Step 3: ###

**Solving the bottom Layer matching with middle cube of each side.**

A) If we have side White sticker check the color of the side one. Put that Color to the middle one. The if the White is left, perform trigger.

B) If we have white side sticker at the bottom row. Perform a left or right trigger. Then perform (A) or (C).

C) If we have any white sticker at the top then Bring that to just opposite of the non white at the bottom and perform Left or right Trigger depending on the positino of the white cube. Then perform Left Trigger or Right Trigger twice. Then perform (A) or (B).





<br> <br> <br>
### Step 4: ###

**Solve the second layer.**

A) Find top eadge piece with non yellow sticker.

B) Match the side color with center of the side. It will form a up side down T of same color.

C) Check the top color then if matchech Right center, hold with right hand Move the T towards me 90D and then Right trigger.

D) Check the top color then if matchech Left center, hold with Left hand Move the T towards me 90D and then left trigger.

If we have misplaced any white sticker, perform the step Left or right trigger depending on the misplaced sticker.

If there is no eadge piece without yellow and middle layer is not solved. Then perform Left or right trigger to biring that.





<br> <br> <br>

### Step 5: ###

**Create a yellow cross on the top.**

A) For 2 yellow edge pieces we should keep it Vertical(3:15 oclock) or 12 and 9 of clock position to you and perform ALGO1

B) If we have one Yello Corner and looks like Fish, make the head face down and Perform ALGO1

To make a Yello Cross at the top(ALGO1): <br>
## FUR--U'R'F' ##

No eadge piece at the top: ALGO1

Perform till we have the Yello Cross at the top.







<br> <br> <br>

### Step 6: ###

**Solve entire Yellow face at the top.**

Check how many top corner has Yellow. We will have either 0 or 2.

A) If we have 0 or 2 top yellow piece then rotate top to bring the side yellow to left side front row and perform ALGO2.

B) If you have fish at the top(1 corner) then rotate the fish head to the bottom left corner and perform ALGO2.

C) Repeate if you have 0 or 2 corner sticker perform ALGO2 untill full top is yellow.

ALGO2: <br>
## RU  R'U  RU  UR' ##




<br> <br> <br>

### Step 7: ###

**To position the Corners of the top pieces.**

If you have any corner pieces matching hold that with left hand and perform the algorithm.

Perform this Until corner pieces match: (ALGO3):<br>
## L'UR -- U' -- LUR' (RU  R'U  RU  UR') ##


<br> <br> <br>

### Step 8: ###

**To position the top eadge pieces.**

Keep the Solve side back of the cube.

To move eadge clock wise(ALGO4):<br>
## F2UR' -- LF2L' -- RUF2 ##

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

To move the eadge counter clock wise: <br>
## F2U'R' -- LF2L' -- RU'F2 ##

________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

**Notations:**

Right Trigger: RTR' (use right hand to rotate 90D Away from me)-(Use right index finger to full toward you by 90D)-(use right had to move 90D towards you).

Left Trigger: L'T'L -- (use left hand to rotate 90D Away from me)-(Use Left index finger to full toward you by 90D)-(use left had to move 90D towards you).

F2: FRONT FACE, 180D

U': UPWARD FACE, 90d CCW

F: Front

B: Bac

L: left

R: Right

U: Up

D: Down

2: two times . e.i 180D




-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Top yellow complesion:
1 : only center:==> F(RUR'U')F'
	This will form a Corner at the top.


2: Move the top as 9 o clocck place
   F(RUR'U')F'   




Once top cross is completed:
 Fix the corner pieces: URU'L'UR'U'L



If the Corner pieces are at the correct place.
R'B'RB
